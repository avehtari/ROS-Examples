- p. 299, $0.5/1.15 = 0.43$ $\rightarrow$ $0.5/1.25 = 0.4$ (thanks to Solomon A. Kurz)
- p. 300, The paragraph starting "We illustrate with the example of the survey earnings and height discussed in Chapter 4." and the next two paragraphs have been edited to:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We illustrate with the survey of earnings and height discussed in Chapter 12.  The coefficient for the sex-earnings interaction in model (12.2) is plausible (a positive interaction, implying that an extra inch of height is worth 2\% more for men than for women), with a standard error of 1\%.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracting another significant figure from the fitted regression yields an estimated interaction of 0.018 with  standard error 0.015.  How large a sample size would have been needed for the coefficient on the interaction to be "statistically significant" at the conventional 95\% level?  A simple calculation uses the fact that standard errors are proportional to $1/\sqrt{n}$.  For a point estimate of 0.018 to be two standard errors from zero, it would need a standard error of 0.009, which would require the sample size to be increased by a factor of $(0.015/0.009)^2$.  The original survey had a sample of 1629; this implies a required sample size of $1629*(0.015/0.009)^2=4500$.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To perform a power calculation for this hypothetical larger survey of 4500 people,  we could suppose that the true
$\beta$ for the interaction is equal to 0.018 and that the standard
error is as we have just calculated.  With a standard error of 0.009
the estimate from the regression would then be conventionally "statistically
significant" only if $\hat{\beta}>0.018$ (or, in other direction, if
$\hat{\beta}< -0.018$, but that latter possibility is highly unlikely
given our assumptions).  If the true coefficient $\beta$ is 0.018, then we would expect $\hat{\beta}$ to
exceed 0.018, and thus achieve statistical significance, with a
probability of $\frac{1}{2}$---that is, 50\% power.  To get 80\% power, we need
the true $\beta$ to be 2.8 standard errors from zero, so that there is
an 80\% probability that $\hat{\beta}$ is at least 2 standard errors
from zero.  If $\beta=0.018\%$, then its standard error would have to be
no greater than $0.018/2.8$, so that the survey would need a sample
size of $1629*(2.8*0.015/0.018)^2=9000$. (thanks to comment by Solomon A. Kurz, and typo fix by Patrick Wen)
