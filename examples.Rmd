## Introduction

- The code and data are provided to fully reproduce the examples
  and figures in the book.  They can be a good way to see what the
  code does. Different people have different styles of code.  The code here
  is not supposed to be a model.  The statistical analyses and
  graphs in the book are intended to be models for good practice,
  but the code here is meant to be simple with minimal dependencies.
- For R programming basics see Appendix A of Regression and Other Stories. If you want to learn more, see our recommendations for [R programming and visualization with R](R_visualizaton.html).

- The folders below (ending /) point to the code (.R and .Rmd)
  and `data` folders (.csv or .txt + codebooks) in github, and .html -files
  point to knitted notebooks.
- Most examples have cleaned data in .csv file in `data` subfolder
  for easy experimenting. For completeness and reproducibility, the
  data subfolders have also the raw data and `*_setup.R` file showing
  how the data pre-processing has been done (to do the exercises
  and follow along with the examples, you don't need to worry about
  the setup code). Most `data` folders hve also some codebook explaining
  the column names.
- For easy access to data sets, there is an R package `rosdata`. You can install it with a command `remotes::install_github("avehtari/ROS-Examples",subdir = "rpackage")`. Then you can access data, for example, as
`library(rosdata)`, `data(wells)`, `head(wells)`. You can get the list of data sets with `?rosdata`.

- When running the notebooks, to avoid need to switch the working directory, `rprojroot` package is used to set the project root directory. The downloaded git repository can be placed anywhere you like and you can rename the ROS-Examples directory if you wish. When running the code, it is sufficient that the working directory is any directory in the ROS-Examples (or renamed). Running
```
library("rprojroot")
root<-has_file(".ROS-Examples-root")$make_fix_file()
```
will find the file `.ROS-Examples-root` which is in the `ROS-Examples` directory, and will set the full path according to that. Then, for example,
```
wells <- read.csv(root("Arsenic/data","wells.csv"))
```
finds the `wells.csv` file, no matter where you have placed or renamed the `ROS-Examples` directory. When you switch to another example, there is no need to switch the working directory.

## Python code

Ravin Kumar, Tomás Capretto, and Osvaldo Martin are porting ROS
examples to Python using bambi (BAyesian Model-Building Interface)
which has similar formula syntax as rstanarm and brms.
