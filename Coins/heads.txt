heads.csv has data from a coin-flipping experiment done in a previous
class. Each student flipped a coin 10 times and we have a count of the
number of students who saw exactly 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 10 heads. See
Appendix B in Regression and Other Stories.

x     - how many heads was seen
count - count of students who saw exactly x heads
